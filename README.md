# Introduction

TON-Splitter is an all-in-one splitwise payment tool that combines telegram bot, split wise and TON wallet Using TON-Splitter can solve the splitting problem in the group quickly. It only needs to record every payment through command, and after a period of time, the best payment method between group members can be obtained by algorithm. At the same time, the integration of TON wallet allows users’ payment can be completed immediately

## TON-Splitter combines the following two features

### 1. Splitwise Algorithm:
Optimized algorithm allows users to use minimum amount and the minimum number of transactions to complete a large number of complicated transactions

### 2. Support TON wallet:
The best user experience, after the transaction is settled in the telegram group, the transaction can be completed directly by connecting the TON wallet (TON keeper)

## Why TON
TON is an emerging and efficient blockchain. Even more exciting is that it can perfectly interact with telegram. Telegram has more than 55.2 million daily active users, which is 100 times that of Ethereum. Therefore, we believe that development on TON must revolve around users.

## Roadmap
